/**
 * Like useState, but returns a third item, a getter. This is a shortcut for the
 * practice of stuffing state into a ref so you can get it back later in a
 * callback without regenerating the callback every time the value changes.
 *
 * This is actually an encapsulation of a practice suggested by the Hooks FAQ
 * itself https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-read-an-often-changing-value-from-usecallback
 *
 * They actually recommend using `dispatch` instead of passing callbacks around.
